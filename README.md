#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 3

For the **Restaurant Reviews projects**, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage Three**, you will take the connected application you built in **Stage One** and **Stage Two** and add additional functionality. You will add a form to allow users to create their own reviews. If the app is offline, your form will defer updating to the remote database until a connection is established. Finally, you’ll work to optimize your site to meet even stricter performance benchmarks than the previous project, and test again using **Lighthouse**.

### Specification

You have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

### What do I do from here?

1. Run "npm install" to install project dependencies.

2. Run "gulp" to begin Gulp tasks and start Browsersync instance.
